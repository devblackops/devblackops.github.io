short-description: Infrastructure test runner using Pester and OVF modules.
long-description: Watchmen is a PowerShell module to make executing Pester tests contained in OVF modules easier using a simple PowerShell-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). It also provides the ability to execute a number of actions (notifiers) upon failing (or successful) infrastructure tests.   Watchmen can also dynamically install OVF modules from public or private PowerShell repositories like the PowerShell Gallery should the module not be found on the system
