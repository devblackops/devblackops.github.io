### Sharing Configurations

Some resource definitions inside your configuration file may have a large number of options associated with them and you may find yourself repeating common configuration options across your resources. For this reason, configuration snippets can be created that will be loaded into your resource configuration when [Get-POSHOriginConfig](https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin/wiki/Get-POSHOriginConfig) is executed. These options are stored inside a file with the **.psd1** extension. This is best used when the option for the resource is expecting a hashtable or an array. You could use this with simple strings or integers but it will be less useful. You reference the **name** of this configuration snippet (minus the .psd1 extension) using the [Get-POSHDefault](https://github.com/devblackops/POSHOrigin/wiki/Get-POSHDefault) function
