### Who is Brandon Olin?

I am a Lead Systems Engineer with a major outdoor apparel company located in Portland, OR. I have over 15 years experience in IT and my primary areas of focus are virtualization, systems management, and automation. I am a former US Marine (tip: never say ex-Marine) having served from 1999 to 2003, a husband to a wonderful wife, a father to a very active toddler, and a home brewer.

“Improvise, Adapt, and Overcome” is a common mantra in the Marine Corps and one that I take to heart in everything I do. There is always a solution to a problem. You just have to have the will and drive to find it. This notion translates well into IT as we are constantly inundated with problems that at first glance may seem impossible to overcome. Not being deterred by these obstacles leaves you with a great sense of satisfaction when you finally find the answer that you were looking for.

With that in mind, I created this site to share ideas and solutions to problems that I and others I know are facing in Systems Management, DevOps, Virtualization, PowerShell, DSC, and related technologies. My hope is that you find this site useful and will give you ideas how you can overcome your own problems in technology.
