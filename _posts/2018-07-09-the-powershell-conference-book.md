On Friday, July 6th, [The PowerShell Conference Book](https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book) was made available for purchase on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/).
This book includes chapters from over 30 PowerShell experts and covers a wide array of topics.
You can think of each chapter like a separate conference talk given by a different speaker, hence the title.
Imagine an entire three or four-day conference distilled down into book form.
Each chapter is about PowerShell but covers different use-cases and scenarios. Most of them are technical in nature and they all contain gems that you should find useful in your day-to-day job.

This project is being run by [Mike F. Robbins](https://twitter.com/mikefrobbins) with the assistance of [Jeffery Hicks](https://twitter.com/JeffHicks) and [Michael T. Lombardi](https://twitter.com/barbariankb).

Mike approached me back in May asking if I'd be interested in collaborating on a new book and I was an immediate **YES**!
I chose a slightly different approach with my chapter in that it is not technical at all.
Instead, I wanted to focus on how PowerShell itself is an enabling technology that can be a gateway to implementing DevOps processes.
My chapter discusses what DevOps is and is not, and how various PowerShell-based projects can enable a DevOps mindset.

Being a agile published book, it is currently **~25%** complete and new chapters are being released as they are finished.
Anyone who purchases the book will get the updates as they are published.
The best part is that **ALL** royalties are donated to the [OnRamp Scholarship](https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/onramp-scholarship/) program run by [The DevOps Collective](https://devopscollective.org/).
The goal of the scholarship program is to help underrepresented groups of people who are new in their careers by giving them a jump start into the IT field, and to help create a more inclusive community overall.

I'm proud to be a part of this effort and I encourage everyone to do their part and **buy this book**.
You will not only be helping yourself by gaining some useful knowledge but will also be helping someone just getting started.
