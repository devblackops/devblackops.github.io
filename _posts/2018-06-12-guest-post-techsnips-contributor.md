My name is Adam Bertram and Brandon has so graciously allowed me to guest post on his blog about a new service I've started that offers free, how-to content for tech professionals. OK, here's the pitch:

We're geeks, right? We love tinkering with tech and figuring out better ways to solve problems. How cool would it be if lots of us could come together under one platform and share our hard-earned knowledge with everyone else via technical demo screencasts? I'm glad you asked!

I recently launched an e-learning platform called [TechSnips](https://www.techsnips.io/contributor-signup). First and foremost, TechSnips is not a Pluralsight, Udemy or LinkedIn Learning. We don't do courses; we do snips. Snips are short (1-10) minute screencasts with absolutely no slides of any kind. Its purpose is to deliver exactly what IT pros, system administrators and other technology professionals need right now. We skip over all of the fluff.

Because of this short format, it's a lot easier to get started contributing if you're new to putting yourself out there in a tech community. You will learn presentation skills through feedback from myself and your peers, you'll be a member of our growing community and get access to our Slack channel, you'll have some great content to put on your resume and you will get paid in monthly royalties! Joining has a ton of upsides but you've got to be willing to put yourself out there.

I'm looking for contributors that can help myself and the dozens of other contributors build the TechSnips content library. As of now, we need to fill a lot of holes so the types of screencasts will most likely be up to you. As long the content fits in the snip format (which you'll get more info in the signup link), the world is your oyster. FYI: We needs lots of PowerShell stuff!

If you're interested, please [sign up](https://www.techsnips.io/contributor-signup)! You'll be asked to do a quick audition and once approved, you'll be part of the TechSnips Contributor community!

I look forward to seeing what new content you can come up with and how teaching others can help yours and others' IT careers flourish!
